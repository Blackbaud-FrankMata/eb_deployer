Elastic Beanstalk provides a great foundation for performing Blue-Green deployments, and EbDeployer add a missing top to automate the whole flow out of box.\r\n\r\nElasticBeanstalk Deployer thus allows you to do continuous delivery on AWS.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'eb_deployer'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install eb_deployer\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Step One: AWS Account Setup\r\n\r\nCreate an AWS IAM user for deploy and give it privilege to operate Elastic Beanstalk. Download the access keys for executing the deployment tasks later.\r\n\r\n### Step Two: Packaging\r\n\r\nYou need package your application for Elastic Beanstalk stack first. For Java app an warball is appropriate. For Ruby on Rails app a tar.gz file is good. You can also package a Rails/Sinatra app as war ball using warbler and deploy to Java stack.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step Three: Define the task\r\nAdd a deploy task for deployment in your Rakefile\r\n\r\n    require 'digest'\r\n\r\n    desc \"deploy our beloved app to elastic beanstalk\"\r\n    task :deploy, [:package] do |t, args|\r\n      EbDeployer.deploy(:application => \"MYAPP\",\r\n                        :environment => \"production\",\r\n                        :solution_stack_name => <SOLUTION_STACK_NAME>\r\n                        :package => args[:package],\r\n                        :version_label => \"dev-\" + Digest::MD5.file(args[:package]).hexdigest)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n### Step Four: Fasten your seat belt\r\nrun deploy task:\r\n\r\n    rake deploy[<package built>] AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<deployers_aws_key> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>\r\nThen open aws console for Elastic Beanstalk to see what happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step Five: Smoke Testing your stack\r\nEB_Deployer allows you to automate your deployment and then some. You can also add smoke tests to your deployment - thus ensuring that the app you deployed is also working correctly. \r\nAdding a smoke test suite is also simple. All that you need to do is edit your rake task as follows:\r\n\r\n    desc \"deploy our simple java app with one page\"\r\n    task :deploy, [:package] do |t, args|\r\n      EbDeployer.deploy(:application => \"MYAPP\",\r\n                        :environment => \"production\",\r\n                        :solution_stack_name => <SOLUTION_STACK_NAME>\r\n                        :package => args[:package],\r\n                        :version_label => \"dev-\" + Digest::MD5.file(args[:package]).hexdigest)\r\n                        :smoke_test => lambda { |host|\r\n                          Timeout.timeout(600) do\r\n                            until `curl http://#{host}`.include?('Hello, World')\r\n                              sleep 5\r\n                            end\r\n                          end\r\n                        })\r\n    end                \r\nYou can add more smoke tests by calling arbitrary tasks from this rake task.\r\nSmoke testing gets you one step closer to continuous delivery.\r\n                      \r\n### Step Six: Blue-Green deployment\r\nSince every deployment now runs smoke test, you now have a better safety net around your deployments. This allows us to trigger automatic blue-green deployments. \r\n\r\nTo do this you need not do anything special. So far we have deployed the application only once. Let's call this the 'green' stack. Any subsequent calls to deployment will deployment a copy of this application to a new stack - the 'blue' stack. Smoke tests will be run on it and once everything passes the 'blue'(new) stack will be switched to the 'green' stack. Thus your new code will now be on the active stack and the user will experience no downtime. \r\n\r\nOnce this new stack is stable or has run for a while you can choose to delete the old stack. Or if you are doing continuous delivery you may be ready to another 'blue' deployment. You could just trigger another deployment and repeat this every hour/day/week... you get the idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Destroying a stack\r\nSo you are done with this application or environment, you can destroy it easily as well.\r\n\r\n    desc \"clean up everything\"\r\n    task :teardown do |t, args|\r\n      EbDeployer.destroy(:application => \"ebtest-simple\")\r\n    end\r\n    \r\nand you are done!\r\n\r\nLater tutorials coming soon will cover\r\n* how to setup multiple environment suites: production, staging, and how to manage configurations for them\r\n* how to setup RDS or other AWS resource and share them between blue green environments\r\n\r\nTake a look at code if you can not wait for the documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
